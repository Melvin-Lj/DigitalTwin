<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project provides a good overview of different providers of digital twins. The idea arose as part of a bachelor thesis, because at this point in time there was no market overview of digital twin providers.

What is a digital twin:
* A digital twin becomes a living virtual image of a real object through the use of sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking with information sources
* Digital twins accompany real objects as real-time copies - starting with their creation through to their disposal. Digital product information is linked with real status and behavior information

Why should you use digital twins:
* With the help of the digital twins, companies can identify problems at an early stage and initiate improvements in development, production, sales and service


Of course, this page does not offer a complete overview of all providers worldwide, but a small overview of currently 49 companies that offer digital twins as software solutions. We look forward to seeing a few more companies to join us in the future.
